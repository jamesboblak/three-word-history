# Three Word History
![TWH demo gif](./assets/demo-assets/TWH_demo.gif)

## Description

Find articles from throughout time in periodical, article, and blog formats and see a graphical representation of the topic's published trending history.

[Three-Word-History](https://jamesboblak.github.io/three-word-history/) will simultaneously send your searchwords back in time to the earliest posted articles from GNewsAPI, as well as to the newest articles and blogposts from newsAPI, and report them for you side by side.  This perspective, along with a scatter plot of the frequency of all articles matching your searchwords over time allows you to see when the articles were trending in history, and how the information in the articles you're reading fit into the overall story's timeline in history.

Teachers, students, historians, writers, and researchers can quickly and easily find, qualify, and compare information as it fits into the bigger story.
